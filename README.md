# Genome_Matching
DNA sequencing for reliable person identification in emergency situations where iris and fingerprint scans are unavailable due to damage.

## Overview
This system facilitates user registration using DNA sequences and their relative's details. In case of an emergency, such as a user meeting with an accident, hospital administrators can use the patient's DNA sequence to identify them and retrieve their relative's information from the database. This allows the hospital to contact the registered relatives for further medical decisions and operations.

### Steps:

## Registration Process

- Users register by providing their DNA sequence and their relative's details.

## Emergency Scenario

- In the event of an emergency, such as an accident, the hospital administrators initiate the identification process.
- Hospital administrators obtain the DNA sequence of the patient.
- The administrators check the database for a match with the patient's DNA sequence.

## Relatives Contact Details Retrieval

- If a match is found, the system retrieves the registered relative details from the database.

## Contact Relatives

- The hospital contacts the registered relatives to inform them about the situation.
- Relatives are informed and involved in making decisions for further medical operations or procedures.
